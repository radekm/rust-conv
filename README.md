# About

The goal of this project is to convert Rust source code to Zig source code.
To be more specific we currently want to convert UI library [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui).

## License

Be careful! This project has non-standard license.
It's open source but not free software.
But note that there are no restrictions on the translated code -
we don't care how you license it or what you do with it.
